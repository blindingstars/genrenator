# Genrenator

I listen to a lot of music, but when someone asks me "What kind?", I'm never quite sure how to answer. It's a little bit of everything, but genres these days are just way too cool for me. For instance, "futurebeats", "chillwave", and "shoegaze" are all awesome, but I'd never guess at their names if I didn't read them online.
